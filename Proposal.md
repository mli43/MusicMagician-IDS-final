Music has been an integral part of human societies for centuries. To understand how music has influenced the collective human experience, we will use a music dataset from Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM) problem D in 2021. Our goal is to visualize the evolution of music from different perspectives, such as artist influence and genre evolution. This dataset can be accessed from ICM’s official website. It consists of four sub-datasets that can be used to answer different questions, two of which are transformed from the ‘full_music_data.csv’ dataset by grouping by artist and year.

There are a number of potential questions we can answer from this dataset. We hope that these questions can help us gain better insight into how mucis influences the collective human experience and how social events impact the evolution of music. Here're some initial questions we hope to answer:

1. How could we define “music influence”? By our definition, who are the most influential artists in music history? Could we find patterns of how one major genre influences the other? What are the relationships between top artists from 1921-2020?
2. What attributes distinguish a genre? How does each genre/artist evolve? 
3. How does the evolution of music attributes reflect the social, cultural, and technological climate?

There are a number of features that our appllication can have. At this phase of the project, we plan to have hierarchical visualization of how different artists influence each other, a cluster that help visualize the similarity between different genres, and charts and graphs that correlate the most popular music genre and music charasteristic such as danceability with historical events. We will continue to add more and adjust our visualizations as we continue development to ensure we gain a deeper understanding of how music interacts with our daily lives and how music is affect by it.
